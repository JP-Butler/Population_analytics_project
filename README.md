# Population_analytics

## World Population Statistics (rough draft)

## Project Description
 - This Project uses Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQLite databases and Visual Studio to take a deep dive into the analytics of the World Population. An HTML website is created using Flask API and the SQLite databases in order to show obtained data in a number of ways. A World map was created which has a popup feature that provides information about all the countries in the world. The pop up shows the user informaiton such as the countries name, 2023 population, yearly percentage change, land area, median age, world share percentage, 2021 life expectency, and more. Below this map is an interactive drop down menu which contains the 10 largest countries in the world. When one of the countries is selected, the page offers information about that country which include the countries populaiton, yearly percentage change, yearly changem median age, fertility rate, the world population percentage share, and the world population. In addition to this information, the drop down menu provides visualizations of the data. Each counrty that is selected comes with a pie chart that shows the countries population percentage compared to the other top 9 and the remainder of the worlds population. The other visualization that is connected to each of the top 10 countries is a line graph that shows the selected countries population growth starting in 1955 and ending in the current year of 2023.
